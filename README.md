# Personal-Narrative-Project
Personal Narrative Project Code.org Lesson 10a. Made by Aleksandr Adamyan period 5 CSA. 02/12/2026

This project is a two-scene animation that shows two core things in my life which are:

1. My experience playing roblox
2. My Journey learning video editing

3. Each Scene uses image filters, animations, texts, and images to create the result which I have.

4. I created 2d arrays, used row major traversals, and created methods throughout this project which are concepts I learned from Unit 5.

5. I really enjoyed making this project as it took me 2 days to make it working 2 hours a day(I am very tired).

6. I hope you enjoy my small little animation :)
